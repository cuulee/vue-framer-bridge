# Vue Framer bridge

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kristianmandrup/vue-framer-bridge.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Bridging the last gap the in design - developer workflow :)

## Goal

To enable rendering of a full [Framer](https://framer.com/) project as a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) app consisting of [Vue components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html) that can gradually be extended as needed.

This should make it easy to progressively enhance a prototype app into a full-blooded real app.

The objective is to implement most/all of the [Framer API](https://framer.com/docs/) in Vue2.

This is a [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) with the following packages:

- `ecma-framer`
- `vue-framer`

## ecma-framer

Let's you code a framer project using modern ECMAScript with modules etc.

## vue-framer

Bridging layer, to turn a Framer project into Vue components that can be progressively enhanced...

## Design

- `Layer`
- `Animation`
- ...
